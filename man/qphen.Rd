\description{
The \code{qphen} dataset contains 176 observations and 24 variables, representing classified phenotype interactions in a quantum game-theoretic model of HIV phenotypes.
The data includes CD4 and viral load differences, quantum game strategies, classification clusters, and tuberculosis/genoresistance indicators.
