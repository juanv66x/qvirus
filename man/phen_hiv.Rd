\title{Calculate Final State and Payoffs in Quantum Game}
\usage{
phen_hiv(strategy1, strategy2, alpha, beta, gamma, theta)
}
\arguments{
\item{strategy1}{A 2x2 matrix representing the strategy of player 1.}

\item{strategy2}{A 2x2 matrix representing the strategy of player 2.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value representing the payoff for outcome |00>.}

\item{beta}{A numeric value representing the payoff for outcome |01>.}

\item{gamma}{A numeric value representing the payoff for outcome |10>.}

\item{theta}{A numeric value representing the payoff for outcome |11>.}
}
\value{
A list containing the final quantum state (\code{final_state}), the payoffs
for each basis state (\code{payoffs}), and the expected payoffs for player 1 (\code{pi_v})
and player 2 (\code{pi_V}).
}
\description{
This function calculates the final quantum state and expected payoffs for two
players in a quantum game based on their strategies. The function uses quantum
gates and unitary transformations to simulate the game dynamics.

\examples{
library(qsimulatR)
strategy1 <- diag(2) # Identity matrix for strategy 1
strategy2 <- diag(2) # Identity matrix for strategy 2
alpha <- 1
beta <- 0.5
gamma <- 2
theta <- 0.1
result <- phen_hiv(strategy1, strategy2, alpha, beta, gamma, theta)
print(result)
