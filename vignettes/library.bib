  abstract  = "Binary classification rules based on covariates typically depend
               on simple loss functions such as zero-one misclassification.
               Some cases may require more complex loss functions. For example,
               individual-level monitoring of HIV-infected individuals on
               antiretroviral therapy requires periodic assessment of treatment
               failure, defined as having a viral load (VL) value above a
               certain threshold. In some resource limited settings, VL tests
               may be limited by cost or technology, and diagnoses are based on
               other clinical markers. Depending on scenario, higher premium
               may be placed on avoiding false-positives, which brings greater
               cost and reduced treatment options. Here, the optimal rule is
               determined by minimizing a weighted misclassification loss/risk.
               We propose a method for finding and cross-validating optimal
               binary classification rules under weighted misclassification
               loss. We focus on rules comprising a prediction score and an
               associated threshold, where the score is derived using an
               ensemble learner. Simulations and examples show that our method,
               which derives the score and threshold jointly, more accurately
               estimates overall risk and has better operating characteristics
               compared with methods that derive the score first and the cutoff
               conditionally on the score especially for finite samples.",

              activities, there remains a tremendous unmet demand for the
              monitoring of the disease progression and treatment success,
              which threatens HIV/AIDS treatment and control. This research
              presented the assessments of viral load and CD4 classification of
              adults enrolled in ART care using machine learning algorithms.
              Methods: We trained, validated, and tested eight machine learning
              (ML) classifier algorithms with historical data, including
              demographics, clinical, and laboratory data. Data were extracted
              from the ART registry database of Yirgacheffe Primary Hospital
              and Dilla University Referral Hospital. ML classifiers were
              trained to predict virological failure (viral load >1000
              copies/mL) and poor CD4 (CD4 cell count <200 cells/mL). The model
              predictive performances were evaluated using accuracy,
              sensitivity, specificity, precision, f1-score, F-beta scores, and
              AUC. Results: The mean age of the sample participants was 41.6
              years (SD = 10.9). The experimental results showed that XGB
              classifier ranked as the best algorithm for viral load prediction
              in terms of sensitivity (97\%), f1-score (96\%), AUC (0.99),
              accuracy (96\%), followed by RF. The GB classifier exhibited a
              better predictive capability in predicting participants with a
              CD4 cell count <200 cells/mL. Conclusion: In this study, the XGB
              and RF models had the highest accuracy and outperformed on
              various evaluation metrics among the models examined for viral
              load classification. In the prediction of participants CD4, GB
              model had the highest accuracy.",

               about ML utility for small sample sizes. In this study, we aim
               to compare the performance of 7 algorithms in the prediction of
               1-year mortality and clinical progression to AIDS in a small
               cohort of infants living with HIV from South Africa and
               Mozambique. The data set (n = 100) was randomly split into 70\%
               training and 30\% validation set. Seven algorithms (LR, Random
               Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor
               (KNN), Na{\"\i}ve Bayes (NB), Artificial Neural Network (ANN),
               and Elastic Net) were compared. The variables included as
               predictors were the same across the models including
               sociodemographic, virologic, immunologic, and maternal status
               features. For each of the models, a parameter tuning was
               performed to select the best-performing hyperparameters using 5
               times repeated 10-fold cross-validation. A confusion-matrix was
               built to assess their accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RF
               ranked as the best algorithm in terms of accuracy (82,8\%),
               sensitivity (78\%), and AUC (0,73). Regarding specificity and
               sensitivity, RF showed better performance than the other
               algorithms in the external validation and the highest AUC. LR
               showed lower performance compared with RF, SVM, or KNN. The
               outcome of children living with perinatally acquired HIV can be
               predicted with considerable accuracy using ML algorithms. Better
               models would benefit less specialized staff in limited resources
               countries to improve prompt referral in case of high-risk
               clinical progression.",

  abstract  = "Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that
               each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled
               independently and with the same distribution for all trees in
               the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s.
               to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large.
               The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends
               on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the
               correlation between them. Using a random selection of features
               to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to

               acknowledged predictive methods employed, for years, in organic
               and medicinal chemistry. More recently, they have assumed a
               central role also in the context of the explorative toxicology
               for the protection of environment and human health. However,
               their real-life application has not been always enthusiastically

               of the most challenging targets of antiretroviral therapy used

               protease inhibitors (PIs) is limited by the development of
               protease mutations that can promote resistance to the treatment.
               The current study was carried out using statistics and
               bioinformatics tools. A series of thirty-three compounds with
               known enzymatic inhibitory activities against HIV-1 protease was
               used in this paper to build a mathematical model relating the
               structure to the biological activity. These compounds were
               designed by software; their descriptors were computed using
               various tools, such as Gaussian, Chem3D, ChemSketch and
               MarvinSketch. Computational methods generated the best model
               based on its statistical parameters. The model's applicability

               proposed as efficient against HIV-1 protease with comparable
               biological activity to the existing ones; this drug candidate
               was evaluated using ADMET properties and Lipinski's rule.
               Molecular Docking performed on Wild Type, and Mutant Type HIV-1
               proteases allowed the investigation of the interaction types
               displayed between the proteases and the ligands, Darunavir (DRV)

               comparative study on the performance of both ligands (DRV \&
               ND). Our study suggested that the new molecule showed comparable
               results to that of darunavir and maybe used for further

               (QSAR) is a computational modeling method for revealing
               relationships between structural properties of chemical
               compounds and biological activities. QSAR modeling is essential
               for drug discovery, but it has many constraints. Ensemble-based
               machine learning approaches have been used to overcome
               constraints and obtain reliable predictions. Ensemble learning
               builds a set of diversified models and combines them. However,
               the most prevalent approach random forest and other ensemble
               approaches in QSAR prediction limit their model diversity to a
               single subject. Results The proposed ensemble method
               consistently outperformed thirteen individual models on 19
               bioassay datasets and demonstrated superiority over other
               ensemble approaches that are limited to a single subject. The
               comprehensive ensemble method is publicly available at
               http://data.snu.ac.kr/QSAR/. Conclusions We propose a
               comprehensive ensemble method that builds multi-subject
               diversified models and combines them through second-level
               meta-learning. In addition, we propose an end-to-end neural

               extract sequential features from a simplified molecular-input

               not show impressive results as a single model, but it was

abstract = {This paper introduces stacked generalization, a scheme for minimizing the generalization error rate of one or more generalizers. Stacked generalization works by deducing the biases of the generalizer(s) with respect to a provided learning set. This deduction proceeds by generalizing in a second space whose inputs are (for example) the guesses of the original generalizers when taught with part of the learning set and trying to guess the rest of it, and whose output is (for example) the correct guess. When used with multiple generalizers, stacked generalization can be seen as a more sophisticated version of cross-validation, exploiting a strategy more sophisticated than cross-validation's crude winner-takes-all for combining the individual generalizers. When used with a single generalizer, stacked generalization is a scheme for estimating (and then correcting for) the error of a generalizer which has been trained on a particular learning set and then asked a particular question. After introducing stacked generalization and justifying its use, this paper presents two numerical experiments. The first demonstrates how stacked generalization improves upon a set of separate generalizers for the NETtalk task of translating text to phonemes. The second demonstrates how stacked generalization improves the performance of a single surface-fitter. With the other experimental evidence in the literature, the usual arguments supporting cross-validation, and the abstract justifications presented in this paper, the conclusion is that for almost any real-world generalization problem one should use some version of stacked generalization to minimize the generalization error rate. This paper ends by discussing some of the variations of stacked generalization, and how it touches on other fields like chaos theory.}

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The site information of substrates that can be
               cleaved by human immunodeficiency virus 1 proteases (HIV-1 PRs)
               is of great significance for designing effective inhibitors
               against HIV-1 viruses. A variety of machine learning-based
               algorithms have been developed to predict HIV-1 PR cleavage
               sites by extracting relevant features from substrate sequences.
               However, only relying on the sequence information is not
               sufficient to ensure a promising performance due to the
               uncertainty in the way of separating the datasets used for
               training and testing. Moreover, the existence of noisy data,
               i.e., false positive and false negative cleavage sites, could
               negatively influence the accuracy performance. RESULTS: In this
               work, an ensemble learning algorithm for predicting HIV-1 PR
               cleavage sites, namely EM-HIV, is proposed by training a set of
               weak learners, i.e., biased support vector machine classifiers,
               with the asymmetric bagging strategy. By doing so, the impact of
               data imbalance and noisy data can thus be alleviated. Besides,
               in order to make full use of substrate sequences, the features
               used by EM-HIV are collected from three different coding
               schemes, including amino acid identities, chemical properties
               and variable-length coevolutionary patterns, for the purpose of
               constructing more relevant feature vectors of octamers.
               Experiment results on three independent benchmark datasets
               demonstrate that EM-HIV outperforms state-of-the-art prediction
               algorithm in terms of several evaluation metrics. Hence, EM-HIV
               can be regarded as a useful tool to accurately predict HIV-1 PR
               cleavage sites.",

  abstract  = "Reconstruction of host-pathogen protein interaction networks is
               of great significance to reveal the underlying microbic
               pathogenesis. However, the current experimentally-derived
               networks are generally small and should be augmented by
               computational methods for less-biased biological inference. From
               the point of view of computational modelling, data scarcity,
               data unavailability and negative data sampling are the three
               major problems for host-pathogen protein interaction networks
               reconstruction. In this work, we are motivated to address the
               three concerns and propose a probability weighted ensemble
               transfer learning model for HIV-human protein interaction
               prediction (PWEN-TLM), where support vector machine (SVM) is
               adopted as the individual classifier of the ensemble model. In
               the model, data scarcity and data unavailability are tackled by
               homolog knowledge transfer. The importance of homolog knowledge
               is measured by the ROC-AUC metric of the individual classifiers,
               whose outputs are probability weighted to yield the final
               decision. In addition, we further validate the assumption that
               only the homolog knowledge is sufficient to train a satisfactory
               model for host-pathogen protein interaction prediction. Thus the
               model is more robust against data unavailability with less
               demanding data constraint. As regards with negative data
               construction, experiments show that exclusiveness of subcellular
               co-localized proteins is unbiased and more reliable than random
               sampling. Last, we conduct analysis of overlapped predictions
               between our model and the existing models, and apply the model
               to novel host-pathogen PPIs recognition for further biological
               research.",

  abstract = "Summary: Supervised learning is widely used in biology for
              prediction, and ensemble learning, including stacking, is a
              promising technique for increasing and stabilizing the prediction
              accuracy. In this study, we developed an R package for stacking.
              This package depends on the R package caret and can handle models
              supported by caret. Stacking involves cross-validation of
              training data with multiple base learners, and the predicted
              values are used as explanatory variables for the meta-learner. In
              the prediction, the testing data were fed into the base models,
              and the returned values were averaged for each base learner. The
              averaged values were then fed into the meta-model, and the final
              predictions were returned. Using this package, the training and
              prediction procedures for stacking can be conducted using one-row
              scripts. Availability and implementation: The R package stacking
              is available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)
              (https://cran.r-project.org/) and GitHub
              (https://github.com/Onogi/stacking). R scripts to reproduce the
              presented results are also reposited at GitHub.",

  author    = "Ruaud, Albane and Pfister, Niklas and Ley, Ruth E and Youngblut,
               Nicholas D",
  abstract  = "Tree ensemble machine learning models are increasingly used in
               microbiome science as they are compatible with the
               compositional, high-dimensional, and sparse structure of
               sequence-based microbiome data. While such models are often good
               at predicting phenotypes based on microbiome data, they only
               yield limited insights into how microbial taxa may be
               associated. We developed endoR, a method to interpret tree
               ensemble models. First, endoR simplifies the fitted model into a
               decision ensemble. Then, it extracts information on the
               importance of individual features and their pairwise
               interactions, displaying them as an interpretable network. Both
               the endoR network and importance scores provide insights into
               how features, and interactions between them, contribute to the
               predictive performance of the fitted model. Adjustable
               regularization and bootstrapping help reduce the complexity and
               ensure that only essential parts of the model are retained. We
               assessed endoR on both simulated and real metagenomic data. We
               found endoR to have comparable accuracy to other common
               approaches while easing and enhancing model interpretation.
               Using endoR, we also confirmed published results on gut
               microbiome differences between cirrhotic and healthy
               individuals. Finally, we utilized endoR to explore associations
               between human gut methanogens and microbiome components. Indeed,
               these hydrogen consumers are expected to interact with
               fermenting bacteria in a complex syntrophic network.
               Specifically, we analyzed a global metagenome dataset of 2203
               individuals and confirmed the previously reported association
               between Methanobacteriaceae and Christensenellales.
               Additionally, we observed that Methanobacteriaceae are
               associated with a network of hydrogen-producing bacteria. Our
               method accurately captures how tree ensembles use features and
               interactions between them to predict a response. As demonstrated
               by our applications, the resultant visualizations and summary
               outputs facilitate model interpretation and enable the
               generation of novel hypotheses about complex systems.",

               R-package and web-application",
  author    = "Neumann, Ursula and Genze, Nikita and Heider, Dominik",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Feature selection methods aim at identifying a
               subset of features that improve the prediction performance of
               subsequent classification models and thereby also simplify their
               interpretability. Preceding studies demonstrated that single
               feature selection methods can have specific biases, whereas an
               ensemble feature selection has the advantage to alleviate and
               compensate for these biases. RESULTS: The software EFS (Ensemble
               Feature Selection) makes use of multiple feature selection
               methods and combines their normalized outputs to a quantitative
               ensemble importance. Currently, eight different feature
               selection methods have been integrated in EFS, which can be used
               separately or combined in an ensemble. CONCLUSION: EFS
               identifies relevant features while compensating specific biases
               of single methods due to an ensemble approach. Thereby, EFS can
               improve the prediction accuracy and interpretability in
               subsequent binary classification models. AVAILABILITY: EFS can

  abstract  = "HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that causes AIDS
               (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), which damages the immune
               system by reducing people's resistance to infections and
               diseases. Antiretroviral treatment methods are based on drug
               designs developed using inhibitors that suppress the dynamics
               that enable the maturation of the virus. However, studies are
               needed to improve treatment methods against infection because
               HIV-1 is frequently mutated and mutant viruses develop
               resistance to the treatment used. Therefore, it is important to
               model the evolutionary development of the virus. For this
               purpose, the developmental process and spread of HIV-1 are
               modeled as a game with the players of phenotypes in this study.
               The related searches known to be made so far have been carried
               out based on the rules of classical physics. However, games of
               survival are being played on the molecular level, where the
               rules of quantum mechanics work. Since the HIV-1 game is being
               played on the molecular level, the behaviors of the virus

               quantum computation, but when we do, it will affect nearly all
               scientific disciplines. In this review, we examine how current
               quantum algorithms could revolutionize computational biology and
               bioinformatics. There are potential benefits across the entire
               field, from the ability to process vast amounts of information

               algorithms for quantum simulation that are poised to improve
