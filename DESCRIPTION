Description: Resources, tutorials, and code snippets dedicated to exploring the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of analyzing Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) lymphocytes and optimizing anti retroviral therapy (ART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). With the emergence of quantum artificial intelligence and the development of small-scale quantum computers, there's an unprecedented opportunity to revolutionize the understanding of HIV dynamics and treatment strategies. This project serves as a platform to discuss, develop, and share insights into leveraging quantum computing techniques to address the challenges in studying the behavior of CD4 lymphocytes and enhancing the efficacy of ART.
