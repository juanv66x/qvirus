Description: Resources, tutorials, and code snippets dedicated to exploring the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of analyzing Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) lymphocytes and optimizing antiretroviral therapy (ART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). With the emergence of quantum artificial intelligence and the development of small-scale quantum computers, there's an unprecedented opportunity to revolutionize the understanding of HIV dynamics and treatment strategies. This project leverages the R package 'qsimulatR' (Ostmeyer and Urbach, 2023, <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qsimulatR>), a quantum computer simulator, to explore these applications in quantum computing techniques, addressing the challenges in studying CD4 lymphocytes and enhancing ART efficacy.
